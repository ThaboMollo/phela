   - Appointment model (src/models/Appointment.ts)
   - Consultation model (src/models/Consultation.ts)
   - Prescription model (src/models/Prescription.ts)
   - Record model (src/models/Record.ts)

4. **Converted Controllers to TypeScript**
   - Auth controller (src/controllers/auth.ts)
   - Users controller (src/controllers/users.ts)
   - MedicalProfiles controller (src/controllers/medicalProfiles.ts)
   - Facilities controller (src/controllers/facilities.ts)
   - Appointments controller (src/controllers/appointments.ts)
   - Consultations controller (src/controllers/consultations.ts)
   - Prescriptions controller (src/controllers/prescriptions.ts)

5. **Converted Routes to TypeScript**
   - Auth routes (src/routes/auth.ts)
   - Users routes (src/routes/users.ts)
   - MedicalProfiles routes (src/routes/medicalProfiles.ts)
   - Facilities routes (src/routes/facilities.ts)
   - Appointments routes (src/routes/appointments.ts)
   - Consultations routes (src/routes/consultations.ts)
   - Prescriptions routes (src/routes/prescriptions.ts)

6. **Server Configuration**
   - Server entry point (src/server.ts)
   - Authentication middleware (src/middleware/auth.ts)
   - Updated imports to use ES6 syntax

7. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Added ESLint with TypeScript support
   - Configured ESLint rules appropriate for a TypeScript Node.js/Express project
   - Added lint scripts to package.json
   - Created ESLINT_SETUP.md with detailed linting documentation

8. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with TypeScript and Yarn information
   - Added .env.example file
   - Updated this migration guide

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for controllers and models
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints

2. **Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production environment

## Migration Process

For each JavaScript file that needs to be converted to TypeScript:

1. Create a new file with the same name but .ts extension
2. Change require statements to import statements
3. Add appropriate interfaces and type definitions
4. Add type annotations to functions and variables
5. Use type assertions where necessary
6. Change module.exports to export default or named exports

## Testing the Migration

After converting each file or group of related files:

1. Run `yarn build` to check for TypeScript compilation errors
2. Fix any type errors that appear
3. Run `yarn dev` to test the application in development mode
4. Test the affected API endpoints to ensure functionality is preserved

## NestJS Migration Consideration

After completing the TypeScript migration, consider migrating to NestJS as outlined in the README.md file. The TypeScript migration is a prerequisite step that will make the NestJS migration smoother.
